# Image-Caption-Generator
Generating Image Captions using Long-Short Term Memory and Recurrent Neural Network.

## Introduction 
- Image Caption Generation is outputting a correct and concise description of a given image.
- Automated captioning of images demands an understanding of the fields of Computer Vision as well as Natural Language Processing.
- Automated captioning is useful in situations where an image takes time to load or is unavailable. 
- These captions can also be used to classify the images.

## Baseline
- We are using the paper “Learning CNN-LSTM Architectures for Image Caption Generation” by Moses Soh as our baseline.
- This paper has proposed using a deep CNN to generate a vectorized representation of an image that is given as input to the LSTM to generate the caption. This is the top-down approach.
- The main drawback of captions generated by models based on the top-down approach is their inability to capture minute details. 
- We have proposed a model that uses a RNN in order to overcome this drawback.
